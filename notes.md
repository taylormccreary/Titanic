# Titanic project progress notes

## NEXT
I should find a valuable way to plot information to determine how to group Age in such a way to improve upon my current
high score, which is only using the passengers' sex.

This most recent submission is not my best. I think my tree is overfitting to the Age values.
I should break those into groups, then try again.

* Go look at some Kaggle Kernels for ideas
* learn about this markdown thing
* improve data visualization

My last two submissions were different, but got the same score...interesting.
